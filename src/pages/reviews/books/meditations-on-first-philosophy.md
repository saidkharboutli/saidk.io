review: "Probably my favorite classic thus far. Much like The Myth of Sisyphus, the Meditations on First Philosophy have somewhat of a pop-philosophy following thanks to the 'I think, therefore I am' principle. However, I think these essays go so much further into the very interesting concept of what can be known and what can not. Though he makes his argument as a case for the existence of God, it still remains a series of exceptionally interesting thought experiments (and some say he was actually areligious). Highly recommend as an introductory philosophy book."
