review: "A great read if you are especially interested in the philosophy of existence. In 'The Myth of Sisyphus', Camus attempts to rationalize human existence on the basis of the absurdity of existence itself. While it was a very interesting read, the classical nature of these essays paired with Camus French background made for a relatively difficult read. Besides that, Camus and I disagree on issues of morality & ethics. Regardless, a good read for philosophy lovers or those that have ever struggled with thoughts of suicide."
