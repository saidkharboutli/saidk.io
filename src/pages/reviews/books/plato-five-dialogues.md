review: "A solid classic that is definitely worth the read. Surprisingly, this book wasn't as difficult of a read as I expected it to be, so props go out to the translator (Grube). Each dialogue covers a different moral or ethical topic. Of the five, I found Apology to be exceptionally monotonous but Phaedo to be very memorable (mostly thanks to the tragic nature of Socrates death). If you're a fan of philosophy, this is a must read."
