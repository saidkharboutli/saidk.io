review: A must watch, in my opinion. I have watched this series at least 4 times at this point, and every single time I walk away with about the same satisfaction as well as newfound easter eggs and previously unnoticed details. Often people say that the first ~1-2 seasons can be slow (but definitely not boring), so give Vince Gilligan some time to set the stage for arguably the best TV show ever produced.
