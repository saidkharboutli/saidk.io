review: Devs is a unique and moving show that appears on its face to be a relatively cookie-cutter sci-fi mini-series. While it does have many classic sci-fi themes, I think Devs makes itself unique by applying them in interesting ways and for interesting reasons (which don't become apparent until the end of the show). I also appreciate the show's dedication to involving real scientific theorems, even if in unscientific ways. On the downside, I think the romance-related themes didn't land very well. Besides that, its a great cast (personal fan of Nick Offerman and Sonoya Mizuno is also in Maniac), a great plot, and a great watch.
