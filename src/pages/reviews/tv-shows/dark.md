review: Definitely the best portrayal of time travel in any piece of media I have consumed. A German mind-bending thriller that will have you asking "wait what..." pretty much every episode. As soon as you feel like you have a good handle on the world Odar and Friese built for this show, they shatter it all right before your eyes, maintaining the shroud of mystery. The ending could have been executed a little better but no regrets, regardless. Highly binge-able. I definitely recommend giving this a watch.
