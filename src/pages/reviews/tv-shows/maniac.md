review: Somewhat like "The End of the F***ing World", this show find its success in its simultaneously unserious and grave contrasting tones. Maniac grapples with addiction, mental health, depression, and failure through fever dream-like scenes as we navigate through the minds of Owen Milgrim and Annie Landsberg (Jonah Hill and Emma Stone, who both did a phenomenal job with this one). It will have you laughing all throughout and tearing up towards the end. Short and binge-able, highly recommend.
