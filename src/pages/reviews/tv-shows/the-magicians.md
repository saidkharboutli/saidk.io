review: This show is the product of a phenonomal story, a relatively solid script, and very average actors and actresses (sorry). The creators of The Magicians did an outstanding job building a world with deep lore backing unique and interesting fantasy themes, particularly magic. The visual art, the magic "system", the God loreâ€”all solid. But wow, some line deliveries are legitamitely painful to listen to. As the show progressed, the actors got more comfortable and this happened less often. If you can appreciate a well thought-out fantasy world, this is a strong recommend.
