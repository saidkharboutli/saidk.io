review: This show toes the line between un-seriously goofy and depressingly real in a way you'll have a hard time finding elsewhere. An odd-ball of a show about two odd-ball characters with odd-ball goals that is somehow relatable (only at times) and concludes in a sad but beautiful way. If its one thing that is certain, it is that this show will make you feel strongly. Feel what, exactly, is another question all-together. It's short and binge-able, highly recommend.
