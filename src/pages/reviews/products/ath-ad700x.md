review: "I have been using the same pair of headphones for about 6 years now. These are those headphones. Besides changing out the pads every so often, these things have handled it all perfectly. I could not even begin to count the number of times these headphones fell on the ground in the most violent fashion possible and somehow every single time they were entirely unaffected. Sound is solid. Expect a massive soundstage & great mids + highs at the cost of deep bass. Great for games in which you may need to hear footsteps."
