review: "Brent Faiyaz has a distinct sound and voice that shines through this album, demonstrated by its nearly half a billion peak listens. The themes Faiyaz works into his music aren't the most fitting for a site like this one, but that is part of why he is as successful as he is. His music involves much of the darker side of love and lust, a distinction that has created somewhat of a 'meme' culture surrounding his music (due to his distinctly toxic lyricism). His skill can not be denied, however."
