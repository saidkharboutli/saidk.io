review: "Peach Pit's music feels like a somber Sunday. Regardless of whether its because of or in spite of that, Being So Normal stands as one of my favorite albums by any band to date. Alrighty Aphordite was the first to hook me, with a goosebump-inducing guitar riff during the first chorus. However, once I picked the album up, I found the slower, somber songs to be the most impactful. Can't recommend Peach Pit enough."
