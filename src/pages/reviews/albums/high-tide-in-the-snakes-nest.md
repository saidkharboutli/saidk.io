review: "This one is most definitely not for everyone, but I would recommend everyone give it a try. $uicideBoy$ are well known for their harsher sound and lyricism and High Tide in the Snakes Nest is no exception. In fact, I think this is one of their harsher albums overall. Ruby and $crim mix hip hop and punk to create an album that does great in the gym. I also find their personal perspectives on life to be a great influence on people going through tough times, mentally. Not for everyone, but give it a shot."
