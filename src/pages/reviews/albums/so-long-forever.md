review: "Likely one of the best albums I've had the pleasure of listening to. Palace blends newer alternative rock styles with classical & blues rock tones to create a unique but comfortable sound. This album has several songs that have landed in my most played over the years. An album I can never get tired of, no matter how much I listen to it. One downsideâ€”there are a one or two songs that may not be everyone's cup of tea. Regardless, a must listen."
