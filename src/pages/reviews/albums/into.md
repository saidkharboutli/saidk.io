review: "Fans of Brent Faiyaz will recognize this name. Sonder was the name Brent produced music under when he first started his career (alongside two producers, Atu and Dpat). Digressing, this album/EP is, in my opion, some of the best music Faiyaz has produced to date. The themes aren't as dark as his more recent music, but the music has a way of producing strong emotions. I attribute this both to his amazing voice, as well as the choir-like backdrop to most of the songs on this project."
