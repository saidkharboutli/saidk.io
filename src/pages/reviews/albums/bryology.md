review: "The Moss has a special ability making music in a wide range of styles. My other favorite from them is the single 'Willie's Song', which is considered reggae. This album, on the other hand, is an alt rock/indie rock inspired album that I highly recommend you give a listen. Not only do they sound great and masterful craft an amazing ambience with the music, they also did an amazing job in lyricism, like on Celebrate, for example. Highly recommend, great vibe."
