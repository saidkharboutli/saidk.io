review: "With over 1 billion listens, this album speaks for itself in terms of quality. Perhaps most surprisingly, this was Joji's debut album. Joji has a very unique sound and style that, I believe, does as well as it does thanks to the distinctly vulnerable lyrics he lays atop music with a very specific somber atmosphere, producing an almost 'cathartic' sort of sound. All this to say, Joji mastered the art of displaying and evoking emotion."
