review: Sickeningly great. In this adaption of the novel by the same name, Darren Aronofsky demonstrates to us a very real horror—addiction. Aronofsky uses many tools, but particularly body horror, to create gut wrenching, sickeningly sobering scenes, contrasted by the relatively calm and ordinary beginning. I think therein lies the power of this movie—the deep contrast between beginning and end; the unexpected and severe progression the movie takes on (typical of Aronofsky). Not for the weak hearted, but if you think you can stomach it, this is a great watch (late at night, with the lights off).
