review: Everything Everywhere All at Once would be too difficult to describe in the short-form reviews that I write on this site. It's a chaotic movie, filled with odd concepts and odd scenes, squashed together into a montage of absurdity. Despite the goofy comedy the movie explicitly aims for, I think Kwan and Scheinert, alongside the entire cast, managed to make a very special movie that is especially moving. There is one line from this movie that still gets me to do this day. I think if you give it a watch, you will know exactly which one that is.
