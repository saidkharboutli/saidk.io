review: Black Swan will have you wanting—but unable—to take your eyes off the screen the entire duration of the movie. Thats not exactly accurate, actually. In typical Aronofsky fashion, the movie has an innocent beginning and you wouldn't guess it was a thriller unless you had seen the promotional art for it. Like Requiem for a Dream, Aronofsky uses a great deal of body and psychological horror to keep you both engaged and wishing you weren't.
