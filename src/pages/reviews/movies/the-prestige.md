review: I must admitâ€”I am a huge fan of Nolan (like most people). This film is true to Nolan's classic modus operandi. It will have you trying to guess what trick, what underlying puzzle, what great plot twist is Nolan going to pull out for this one. On that front, the movie delivers (hopefully this doesn't count as a spoiler). Kept me and my friends on the edge of our seats the entire time we watched through. A mystery very much worth watching alone or with a group.
