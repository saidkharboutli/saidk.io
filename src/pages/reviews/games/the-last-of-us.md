review: I am and have always been a big fan of Naughty Dog. I grew up playing all of the Uncharted games, a series near and dear to my heart. Thus, I wasn't too surprised by their ability to hit a home run with this title. Phenomenal gameplay mechanics (especially for the time), great visuals and world design, one of the best backstories to any zombie media I've encountered, and (most importantly) a really, really good story. A story so good, TLOU will leave you questioning right and wrong on a fundamental level. Strong recommend.
