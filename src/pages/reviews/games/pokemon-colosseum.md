review: I am trying my best not to let nostalgia affect my rating on this one. However, I solemnly believe this is the best Pokémon game ever created. Yes, it doesn't have many catch-able Pokémon. Yes, you can't catch wild Pokémon. Yes, it's quite dated. Despite all of that, this game stands as the most memorable to me. The soundtrack is marvelous, like in the boss battles; the themes are more mature and darker than typical Pokémon games, which I think is awesome; the non-standard starters are refreshing; and the character and world design is much cooler and more mature than any other Pokémon game I've played. Strongly recommend if you enjoy Pokémon and haven't played this one yet.
