review: As far as games go, this may be one of the most, if not THE most, perfect game ever crafted. The developers at Rockstar hit unbelievable highs with this title. Mechanically, the game is fun and has many unique but refined features you wont find in other games, especially not at this level of quality. Visually, their graphical updates have made this game an absolute beauty. Most importantly, the story could make a grown man cry (it did). Absolutely phenomonal, through and through. Might seem a little slow in the middle, but hang on for the ride. You definitely will not regret it.
