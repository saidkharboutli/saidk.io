**Disclaimer:** I will be following [Andrew Ramadayal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewramdayal/)'s TIA Education course & book. I would highly recommend you pick it up ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/PMP-Exam-Prep-Simplified-Learning/dp/B08SBFTXQT)). These notes are not a replacement for his course, where he will cover more than just content (mindset and tips). You also need to take his (or someone else's) 35 hour course to take the exam in the first place.

These are **all** my personal, handwritten notes, converted to text (via reMarkable), and cleaned up and reformatted with ChatGPT (GPT does a great job fixing the formatting for me).

This post is part 3 in my "Studying for the PMP" series. This part is an overview of the performance domains, according to PMI.

## Overview

- Group of related activities to ensure delivery of project outcomes
- Interactive, interdependent, and interrelated
- Specific activities will be determined by project context, stakeholders, etc...
- Review PMBOK 6th ed. Fig. 1-1

## Stakeholder Performance Domain

- Addresses activities and functions associated with stakeholders
- You want:
  1. Productive working relationship with stakeholders
  2. Stakeholder agreement with project objectives
  3. Beneficiary stakeholders are satisfied, while opposition stakeholders don't negatively impact the project

- Stakeholder Engagement Cycle:
  1. Identify - who are your stakeholders and what do they want (ongoing)
  2. Understand and Analyze - seek to understand stakeholder feelings and values
  3. Prioritize - focus on stakeholders with the most power and interest
  4. Engage - collaborate with stakeholders to introduce the project, gather requirements, manage expectations, resolve issues, negotiate,
  prioritize, problem solve, and make decisions
  5. Monitor - as the project progresses, stakeholders change and so do their requirements.

- Delivery cadence: Timing and frequency of deliverables
- Outcomes include:
  1. Correct development approach
  2. A project life cycle that connects the delivery of business value with stakeholder value
  3. Project life-cycle composed of phases that facilitate project deliverables

  2. Adaptive Approach (i.e. agile)
  3. Hybrid
- Factors to determine approach:
  - Dealing with the product:
    1. Degree of innovation
    2. Certainty of requirements
    3. Scope stability
    4. Ease of change
    5. Delivery options

## Planning

- Activities and functions associated with ongoing coordination necessary for delivering project deliverables
- The purpose of planning is to proactively develop an approach to create deliverables
- Outcomes include:
  1. Project moves in an organized and deliberate method
  2. Holistic approach to project outcomes
  3. Progressive elaboration
  4. Time spent planning is appropriate
  5. Planning is sufficient to manage stakeholder expectations
  6. There is a process to handle changing plans
- Because projects are unique, planning varies for each project.
  - Project planning variables include:
    1. Development approach
    2. Project deliverables
    3. Organizational requirements
    4. Market conditions
    5. Legal or regulatory considerations
  - Project planning considerations:
    1. Delivery - scope of deliverables
    2. Estimating - scope, schedule, budget, people, resources
    3. Schedules - models to determine when work should be done

- Planning for building a team starts with identifying required skills to complete the project
- Communication plans must include stakeholder analysis and engagement
- Physical resources are resources *other than people*
- Procurement planning must happen throughout the project
- Plan on how to deal with changes (i.e. a change plan)
- Plan for risks that may be encountered

  2. Project realizes the outcomes
  3. Project realized within the time frame

## Measurement Performance Domain

- Activities and functions associated with assessing project performance and maintaining acceptable performance
- Outcomes include:
  1. Reliable understanding of project status
  2. Actionable data to enable decision making
  3. Timely and appropriate actions to keep the project on track
  4. Achieving targets and generating business value
- This domain bridges the Delivery Performance Domain with the Plan Performance Domain.
- We measure for many reasons:
  1. Evaluating performance compared to plan
  2. Tracking utilization of resources
  3. Demonstrating accountability
  4. Providing information to stakeholders
  5. Assessing whether project deliverables will meet customer acceptance criteria
  6. Assessing whether project deliverables are on track
- Creating effective measurements helps ensure the right things are being measured
- Ways to measure:
  - **Key Performance Indicators** (KPIs):
    - Leading indicator - predicts changes or trends
    - Lagging indicator - measures deliverables or events
  - Utilize SMART
    1. Specific
    2. Meaningful
    3. Achievable
    4. Relevant
    5. Timely
  - Create a range: what is acceptable and what is unacceptable

- What to measure:
  1. Deliverables
    - Errors or defects
    - Measures of performance
  2. Delivery
    - Work in progress
    - Lead time
    - Cycle time
    - Process efficiency
  3. Baseline performance
    - Start and finish dates
    - Actual cost compared to planned cost
  4. Resources
    - Planned vs. actual resource utilization
  5. Business value
    - Cost-benefit ratio
  6. Stakeholders
    - Mood chart
  7. Forecasts

- Presenting metrics:
  1. Dashboards
  2. Information radiators (common in software teams)
  3. Visual control

- Pitfalls with measurements:
1. Hawthorne effect - working to pass a specific measure/test rather than the actual requirements
2. Vanity metric - judging team performance based on one metric
3. Demoralization - common outcome of vanity metric, team feels demoralized
4. Misuse - misrepresenting a metric (very easy to do unintentionally)
5. Confirmation bias - measuring in a way that fits your bias

  4. The capacity to anticipate threats and opportunities
  5. Project delivery with little or no negative impact
  6. Opportunities are realized to increase project performance and outcomes
  7. Cost and schedule reserves are used
- Projects happen in environments with varying uncertainty
- Shades of uncertainty:
  1. Risks - not knowing the future
  2. Ambiguity - not aware of current or future conditions
  3. Complexity - dynamic systems with unpredictable outcomes
- Responding to uncertainty:
  1. Gather as much data as possible
  2. Plan and prepare for many different outcomes
  3. Build-in resiliency
- **Volatility** exists in environments subject to rapid and unpredictable change
  - Can also occur when resources and skills are fluctuating
