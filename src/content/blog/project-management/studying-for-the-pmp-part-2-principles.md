**Disclaimer:** I will be following [Andrew Ramadayal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewramdayal/)'s TIA Education course & book. I would highly recommend you pick it up ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/PMP-Exam-Prep-Simplified-Learning/dp/B08SBFTXQT)). These notes are not a replacement for his course, where he will cover more than just content (mindset and tips). You also need to take his (or someone else's) 35 hour course to take the exam in the first place.

These are **all** my personal, handwritten notes, converted to text (via reMarkable), and cleaned up and reformatted with ChatGPT (GPT does a great job fixing the formatting for me).

This post is part 2 in my "Studying for the PMP" series. This part is an overview of the 12 major PM principles, according to PMI.

## Introduction to PM Principles

- Principles serve as foundational guidelines for Strategy, decision making, and problem solving
- Professional standards and methodologies are often based on principles
- Principles for project management provide guidance for the behavior of people involved with projects

## PMI Code of Ethics

- Principles can but do not necessarily reflect morals
- A code of ethics for a profession can be adopted by an individual or profession to establish expectations for moral conduct
- The PMI values are:
  1. Responsibility - You own the project's successes AND failures
  2. Fairness - Be fair to your team and stakeholders
  3. Respect - Be respectful to your team and stakeholders
  4. Honesty - Don't lie. You will almost certainly fail the project by lying

## The 12 Principles of Project Management

1. [Diligent, respectful, and caring Steward](#stewardship)
2. [Create a collaborative project team environment](#team)
3. [Effectively engage with Stakeholders](#stakeholders)
4. [Focus on value - why are we doing this project?](#value)
5. [Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions](#systems-thinking)
6. [Demonstrate leadership behaviors](#leadership)
7. [Tailor based on context - requirements and plans can change without notice](#tailoring)
8. [Build quality into process and deliverables](#quality)
9. [Navigate complexity](#complexity)
10. [Optimize risk responses](#risk)
11. [Embrace adaptability and resiliency](#adaptability-and-resiliency)
12. [Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state](#change)

### Stewardship

- Definition: The act of taking care or managing something
- Basically, be a good person!
- Carry out actions with integrity, care, and trustworthiness
- Keep compliance of internal and external guidelines
- Broad commitment to financial, social, and environmental impacts

Breakdown:

1. Integrity - be honest
2. Care - diligently oversee organizational matters in your charge
3. Trustworthiness - present yourself accurately
4. Compliance - Stewards comply with laws, rules, regulations, and requirements

A holistic view of stewardship considers financial, social, technical, and sustainable environmental awareness.

### Team

- Creating a collaborative project team environment
- Project teams do the actual project work
- Project teams collaborate to complete objectives more efficiently than possible alone
- Project teams work within organizational and professional guidelines, often forming a local culture
- A collaborative team environment facilitates:
  - Alignment with other organizational cultures and guidelines
  - Individual and team learning and development
  - Optimal contributions to deliver desired outcomes
- Project Teams will be affected by:
  1. Team agreements - represent a set of behavioral patterns
  2. Organizational Structures - Project teams use, tailor, and implement structures that help
  3. Process - Project teams define processes that enable completion of tasks and work assignments
- Transparency on roles and responsibilities can improve team cultures. This can include defining:
  1. Authority - having the right, within a given context, to make relevant decisions, establish or improve procedures, apply project resources, expend funds, or give approvals
  2. Accountability - Condition of being answerable for an outcome. Accountability is not shared
  3. Responsibility - condition of being obligated to do or fulfill something. Responsibility can be shared
- A diverse project team can develop the project atmosphere by bringing together different perspectives
- Teams should incorporate practice standards, ethical codes, and other guidelines as part of the professional work
- Free exchange of individual knowledge

### Stakeholders

- Must keep stakeholders properly engaged!
- Typically the customer when PMBOK mentions stakeholders, BUT stakeholders are anyone affected by the project
- Engaged stakeholders lead to greater project success and customer satisfaction
- Stakeholders impact projects, performance and outcomes:
  1. Scope/requirements
  2. Schedule
  3. Cost
  4. Project team/resources
  5. Plans
  6. Outcomes
  7. Culture
  8. Benefit realization
  9. Risk
  10. Quality
  11. Success
- Identify, analyze, and proactively engage with stakeholders consists of finding out how, when, under what situations, and how often stakeholders should/want to be engaged
- Interpersonal skills are important for this! Initiative, integrity, collaboration respect, empathy, confidence
- This process will help project teams collect and utilize stakeholder feedback to minimize potential negative impacts and maximize positive ones

### Value

- Output of a project will provide value to your stakeholders
- Continually evaluate and adjust project alignment to business objectives to maximize value
- Value is the ultimate indicator of project success
- Value can be realized at the end of a project (waterfall) or all throughout (Agile)
- Values can be quantitative or qualitative
- Focus on outcomes allows project teams to support the intended benefits that lead to value creation
- Value is subjective and ultimately defined by stakeholders. We can use a "business case" to describe value in clearer terms:
  - Business need - what is unique that this project provides? How does it satisfy a specific organizational need?
  - Project Justification - Can you justify filling this need? Do the "pros" outweigh the "cons"?
  - Business Strategy - How will you implement this solution to achieve the stated value?

### Systems Thinking

- Build a system to efficiently relate project components
- A system is a set of interacting and independent components that function as a unified whole
- A project is a system of interdependent and interacting domains of activity
- Recognize, evaluate, and respond to the dynamic circumstances within and surrounding the project in a holistic way to positively affect project performance
- How do internal project parts and external systems interact with each other?
- Systems are constantly changing
- Important that project teams think like this as well
- An organization is also a system, so a project is one part within a larger system
- Internal and external factors are always changing - one change can have many impacts

### Leadership

- Demonstrate and adapt leadership behaviors to support individual and team needs
- Effective leadership promotes project success and contributes to positive project outcomes
- Any project team member can demonstrate leadership
- Leadership is different than authority
- Effective leaders adapt their style to the situation
- Effective leaders recognize different motivations among team members
- Leaders demonstrate honesty, integrity, and ethical conduct
- Effective projects have multiple team members using effective leadership skills (i.e., team leads)
- Ensure leaders are aligned to avoid internal conflict
- Authority is the right to exercise control. Authority is not leadership
- Leadership is motivating and inspiring people to collaboratively achieve a common goal
- PM AND team members can exhibit leadership skills, such as:
  1. Focusing project team around shared goal
  2. Articulating a motivating vision for the project
  3. Generating consensus on the best way forward
  4. Overcoming obstacles to project progress
  5. Resolving conflict
  6. Adapting communication style to stakeholders
  7. Mentoring fellow team members
  8. Having self-awareness of one's own bias and behaviors
  9. Adapting to change during the project
- Projects work best when leaders understand what motivates people!
- By mixing styles and leveraging motivators, any project team member or stakeholder can motivate or influence the team

### Tailoring

- There are too many methods/approaches to count
- This principle is deciding what is right for this project
- Every project is unique (by definition)
- Approach should be selected based on the needs of the project, its stakeholders, its governance, and its environment
- "Just enough" process to accomplish desired outcome while maximizing value, minimizing cost, and enhancing speed
- Tailoring is iterative! Adapt to your environment
- Project team should always have an open mind about changing approaches
- A tailored approach can lead to: deeper commitment from project team, reduction in waste, customer-oriented focus, increased efficiency

### Quality

- Never an excuse to not deliver value
- Meeting the acceptance criteria for a deliverable
- Quality is about satisfying stakeholders' expectations and fulfilling project and product requirements
- Project quality ensures processes are appropriate and as effective as possible
- Quality has many dimensions:
  1. Performance - fast/powerful enough
  2. Conformity - Meets all requirements
  3. Reliability - Can be relied on
  4. Resilience - Can take a hit
  5. Satisfaction - Satisfies customers
  6. Efficiency - Not wasteful
  7. Sustainability - Can be produced/used without major restriction
- Metrics and acceptance criteria are used to set standards for and test for quality
- Team should understand acceptance criteria

### Complexity

- How to properly navigate project complexity
- Complexity comes from: human behavior, system interactions, uncertainty, and ambiguity
- Complexity can arise at any point during the project, sometimes can't be predicted!
- Anticipate, evaluate, and navigate complexity and enable the project team to navigate that complexity
- Complexity can be introduced by events and conditions, both internal and external
- Stay vigilant in identifying complexity, and keep an open mind about what method to use in order to reduce complexity
- Technological innovations can be a source of complexity

### Risk

- Everything has risk
- Risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can have a positive or negative effect on one or more objectives
- Risks can be positive OR negative
  - Positive risk - "opportunity"
  - Negative risk - "threat"
- Always seek to maximize opportunities and minimize threats
- Constantly evaluate and re-evaluate exposure to risk
- Risk response must be:
  - Appropriate for the magnitude of risk
  - Cost-effective
  - Realistic for project context
  - Agreed to by relevant stakeholders
  - Owned by a responsible person
- Every organization has a risk "appetite" - this will affect how risk is managed

### Adaptability and Resiliency

- Adaptability is the ability to respond to changing conditions
- Resiliency is the ability to absorb "impacts" and to recover quickly from a setback or failure
- Build adaptability and resiliency into the organization's and project team's approaches
- Focus on outcomes over outputs increases adaptability
- A project rarely goes as planned!
- A project exists in, and is constantly interacting with changing internal and external systems
- A project is influenced by the system it exists in
- Capabilities that support adaptability and resilience:
  1. Short feedback loops
  2. Continuous learning and improvement
  3. Regular inspections
  4. Open and transparent planning which engages the stakeholders
  5. Small-scale prototypes, experiments, or demos
  6. Open organizational communication
  7. Diverse project teams with unique backgrounds and skills
  8. Learning from the past
- Having controls built-in keeps projects under budget and on time, by helping recover quickly from setbacks and changes
- Learn from the past to speed up recovery further!

### Change

- Prepare those impacted for the acceptance to go from the current state to the intended future one (created by project output)
- A structured approach will help with transitioning
- Some stakeholders may not readily embrace change
- Change can originate from internal or external sources
- Change fatigue is the result of making too many changes in a short time
- Change is best made incrementally
- Stakeholder engagement and motivational approaches help with adoption
- Remaining relevant is challenging, and change is essential to remain relevant
- Change is challenging, so use motivation, not force
