However, I solemnly believe this is the best Pokémon game ever created. Yes, it doesn't have many catch-able Pokémon. Yes, you can't catch wild Pokémon. Yes, it's quite dated. Despite all of that, this game stands as the most memorable to me. The soundtrack is marvelous, like in the boss battles; the themes are more mature and darker than typical Pokémon games, which I think is awesome; the non-standard starters are refreshing; and the character and world design is much cooler and more mature than any other Pokémon game I've played.

These notes are not a replacement for his course, where he will cover more than just content (mindset and tips). You also need to take his (or someone else's) 35 hour course to take the exam in the first place.\n\nThese are **all** my personal, handwritten notes, converted to text (via reMarkable), and cleaned up and reformatted with ChatGPT (GPT does a great job fixing the formatting for me).\n\nThis is the first entry in the \"Studying for the PMP\" series. This section will cover both the basics of the PMP exam and the first _actual_ section, an overview of basic terms.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe PMP exam is an obvious choice for Project Managers looking to add more heft to their name, especially \"younger\" project managers. The Project Management Institute (PMI) is the administering body.\n\n### Requirements\n\nIn order to take the exam, you must have the following credentials (for applicants without a 4-year degree, the requirements are different):\n\n1. A 4-year Degree\n2. 36 months of project manag*ing*\n3. Complete a 35-hour PMP course OR attain the CAPM Certification\n\n### Exam Outline\n\nThe exam is 180 questions long, lasts 4 hours, and can be taken at home or at a test site. The exam is broken into the following domains:\n\n1. People (42%) - Best practices for people management\n2. Process (50%) - Best practices for processes\n3. Business Environment (8%) - Project context\n\nThe exam has the following question types:\n\n1. Multiple Choice (majority)\n2. Multiple Response\n3. Matching\n4. Hot spot (select an area on an image)\n5. Fill-in-the-blank\n\n### Maintaining the PMP\n\nIn order to maintain the PMP, you must complete 60 Professional Development Units (PDU's) in a 3-year period. These can be gained by:\n\n1. Taking a class (1 PDU/hr)\n2. Teaching a Class (1 PDU/**prep** hr)\n3. Attending a Chapter meeting (1 PDU/hr)\n\nIf you fail to complete 60 PDU's in a 3-year span, your PMP certification will be taken away. You will have to take the exam all over again. Avoid this.\n\n### PMP Application\n\nStart thinking about what you want to include as a Project on your application! Remember: 36 months of management. Your role doesn't matter, just that you were in some way _managing a project_.\n\n## Project Management Terms (An Overview)\n\n### Project\n\n- **Definition:** A temporary endeavor that produces a unique product, service, or result.\n- Projects are **Temporary** (as opposed to \"operations\").\n- Projects are **Unique**: the output of the project is unique.\n- Projects are **Progressively Elaborated**: as time/project progresses, requirements become clearer.\n\n### Project Management\n\n- **Definition:** Application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to satisfy project requirements.\n- Parts include:\n  1. Preparing a business case to justify the investment.\n  2. Estimating resources and time.\n  3. Developing and implementing a management plan for the project.\n  4. Leading and motivating the project team.\n  5. Managing risks, issues, and changes on the project.\n  6. Monitoring progress against plan.\n  7. Closing procedure (closing project in a controlled fashion).\n\n### Value of a Project\n\n- What value will this project bring to the company upon completion.\n- Why should we undertake this project?\n- _Possible project values:_ Money, Brand Reputation, New or Changed Operations, Customer Service, or a New Product or Service.\n\n### Operations Management\n\n- Deals with \"ongoing\" production of goods and services.\n- Consider the acquisitions, development, and utilization of resources that firms need to deliver the goods and services.\n- Projects and operations are distinct - **projects are temporary**, operations are ongoing.\n\n### Program Management\n\n- **Definition:** Group of related projects managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually.\n  - There must be some value add in managing them together.\n- A project may or may not be part of a program, but a program will always have projects.\n- It focuses on the project interdependencies and helps to determine the optimal approach for managing them.\n\n### Portfolio Management\n\n- **Definition:** A portfolio is a collection of **projects**, **programs**, **subsidiary portfolios**, and **operations** _managed as a group_ to achieve strategic objectives.\n- The hierarchy is as follows: Projects \u003C Programs \u003C Portfolios.\n\n### Phases\n\n- **Definition:** A phase is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of one or more deliverables.\n- The number of phases can depend on the Industry type, project size, and complexity of the project.\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- A deliverable is any unique and product, service, or result.\n- May be tangible (a new car or a new piece of software) or intangible (a result, like a successful testing phase).\n- Must be accepted by customer/ sponsor for the given phase.\n\n### Project Life Cycle\n\n- A representation of phases that a project typically goes through. Can be predictive or adaptive:\n  1. Predictive - waterfall - needs are solid to begin with.\n  2. Adaptive - agile - adapts to changing needs of the stakeholders.\n\n### Project Governance\n\n- **Definition:** Frameworks, functions, and processes that guide project management activities in order to create a unique product, service, or result.\n- All companies have a different framework—it should be tailored to the businesses.\n- It determines what processes you use to complete the project.\n\n### Stakeholders\n\n- **Definition:** Individuals, groups, or organizations that may affect, be affected by, or perceive to be affected by the project.\n- Key stakeholders include:\n  1. Project manager - manages the project.\n  2. Customer - uses the deliverable.\n  3. Project team - individuals completing the project work.\n  4. Project sponsor - provides resources and support.\n  5. Functional manager - departmental manager i.e. \"Manager of Engineering\", \"Vice President of Marketing\", \"Director of IT\", etc... (anyone who manages organizational resources)\n- A stakeholder is **ANYONE** affected or perceived to be affected by the project.\n- Customers are considered the most important stakeholder—a project could be on time and under budget, but customers decide if it actually was a success.\n\n### Project Roles\n\n- Project Manager (you are always the project manager):\n  - Empowered to lead the project.\n  - Authorized to make decisions.\n  - Responsible for the success and failure of the project.\n- Project Coordinator:\n  - Less authority than a project manager.\n  - _May_ be authorized to make decisions.\n- Project Expediter:\n  - The least authority in the project management \"world\".\n  - Very limited decision-making ability.\n\n### Project Management Office (PMO)\n\n- **Definition:** Organizational structure that standardizes the processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques.\n- Types include:\n  1. Supportive: Supports PM by providing templates, training, or lessons learned.\n  2. Controlling: Defines company framework.\n  3. Directive: Controls the whole project, and the PM reports directly to the PMO.\n\n### Organizational Structure\n\n- **Functional Organizations:** Structure that groups staff members according to their area of expertise.\n  - Functional structures have functional teams that report to a functional manager (sales, engineering, etc...).\n- **Matrix Organizations:** Structure can be broken down into three different matrix structure types—weak, balanced, and strong.\n  - Structure type refers to PM authority in relation to functional manager authority (weak means functional manager has more authority than PM).\n- **Project Oriented Organizations:** Structure where PM has the greatest amount of authority.\n  - Team members are only ever part of a project, not functional groups.\n  - When a project is over, team members move to new projects, not back to functional departments like they might in other structures.\n- **Hybrid:** As the name suggests, it's a mix of the above.\n- _In general_, the organization structure tells us who has more control over **resources**, the PM or the functional manager.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- The following are the important constraints defined by PMBOK6:\n  1. Scope: do exactly _this_, no more & no less.\n  2. Schedule: do it within _this_ amount of time.\n  3. Cost: don't spend more than _this_ amount.\n  4. Risk: watch out for _these_ things.\n  5. Quality: make sure _this_ is high enough to make the customer is happy.\n  6. Resources: make sure you have _this_ (tools & people) in order to complete the project.\n\n### Process Groups\n\n- There are five process groups in project management, according to the PMBOK6:\n  1. Initiating (2 processes)\n  2. Planning (24 processes)\n  3. Execution (10 processes)\n  4. Monitor and Control (12 processes)\n  5. Closing (1 process)\n- In total, there are 49 processes across these 5 process groups.\n\n### Knowledge Areas\n\n- There are 10 knowledge areas in project management, according to the PMBOK6:\n  1. Integration - Summary of all other areas (7 processes)\n  2. Project Scope - Creating project objectives (6 processes)\n  3. Project Schedule - Creating a timeline of objectives (6 processes)\n  4. Project Cost - Creating a budget (4 processes)\n  5. Project Quality - Gathering quality expectations and controlling quality (3 processes)\n  6. Project Resources - Estimating available and needed resources (6 processes)\n  7. Project Communications - How to properly communicate with stakeholders (3 processes)\n  8. Risk Management - Identifying and controlling for possible and current risks (7 processes)\n  9. Procurement Management - Managing vendors and ensuring they can & will deliver on promises (3 processes)\n  10. Stakeholder Management - Managing your stakeholders (4 processes)\n\n### Process Groups vs. Knowledge Areas Chart\n\n- You should be able to draw this chart from memory:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/images/posts/studying-for-the-pmp-part-1-terms/project-management-process-groups.jpg\">\n\n### Process\n\n- **Definition:** A process combines inputs, tools, and techniques to execute on a purpose for the project and produce an output.\n- Can be broken down into three parts:\n  - **Input**: Starting point for process or the \"raw materials\". The input for one process can be the output of a previous process.\n  - **Tools and Techniques**: The actions or methods that are used to transform the raw materials into output.\n  - **Output**: The result of our efforts.","src/content/blog/project-management/studying-for-the-pmp-part-1-terms.md","8a1dc1531b5ef0be",{"html":791,"metadata":792},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Disclaimer:\u003C/strong> I will be following \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewramdayal/\">Andrew Ramadayal\u003C/a>’s TIA Education course &#x26; book.

This part is an overview of the 12 major PM principles, according to PMI.\n\n## Introduction to PM Principles\n\n- Principles serve as foundational guidelines for Strategy, decision making, and problem solving\n- Professional standards and methodologies are often based on principles\n- Principles for project management provide guidance for the behavior of people involved with projects\n\n## PMI Code of Ethics\n\n- Principles can but do not necessarily reflect morals\n- A code of ethics for a profession can be adopted by an individual or profession to establish expectations for moral conduct\n- The PMI values are:\n  1. Responsibility - You own the project's successes AND failures\n  2. Fairness - Be fair to your team and stakeholders\n  3. Respect - Be respectful to your team and stakeholders\n  4. Honesty - Don't lie. You will almost certainly fail the project by lying\n\n## The 12 Principles of Project Management\n\n1. [Diligent, respectful, and caring Steward](#stewardship)\n2. [Create a collaborative project team environment](#team)\n3. [Effectively engage with Stakeholders](#stakeholders)\n4. [Focus on value - why are we doing this project?](#value)\n5. [Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions](#systems-thinking)\n6. [Demonstrate leadership behaviors](#leadership)\n7. [Tailor based on context - requirements and plans can change without notice](#tailoring)\n8. [Build quality into process and deliverables](#quality)\n9. [Navigate complexity](#complexity)\n10. [Optimize risk responses](#risk)\n11. [Embrace adaptability and resiliency](#adaptability-and-resiliency)\n12. [Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state](#change)\n\n### Stewardship\n\n- Definition: The act of taking care or managing something\n- Basically, be a good person!\n- Carry out actions with integrity, care, and trustworthiness\n- Keep compliance of internal and external guidelines\n- Broad commitment to financial, social, and environmental impacts\n\nBreakdown:\n\n1. Integrity - be honest\n2. Care - diligently oversee organizational matters in your charge\n3. Trustworthiness - present yourself accurately\n4. Compliance - Stewards comply with laws, rules, regulations, and requirements\n\nA holistic view of stewardship considers financial, social, technical, and sustainable environmental awareness.\n\n### Team\n\n- Creating a collaborative project team environment\n- Project teams do the actual project work\n- Project teams collaborate to complete objectives more efficiently than possible alone\n- Project teams work within organizational and professional guidelines, often forming a local culture\n- A collaborative team environment facilitates:\n  - Alignment with other organizational cultures and guidelines\n  - Individual and team learning and development\n  - Optimal contributions to deliver desired outcomes\n- Project Teams will be affected by:\n  1. Team agreements - represent a set of behavioral patterns\n  2. Organizational Structures - Project teams use, tailor, and implement structures that help\n  3. Process - Project teams define processes that enable completion of tasks and work assignments\n- Transparency on roles and responsibilities can improve team cultures. This can include defining:\n  1. Authority - having the right, within a given context, to make relevant decisions, establish or improve procedures, apply project resources, expend funds, or give approvals\n  2. Accountability - Condition of being answerable for an outcome. Accountability is not shared\n  3. Responsibility - condition of being obligated to do or fulfill something. Responsibility can be shared\n- A diverse project team can develop the project atmosphere by bringing together different perspectives\n- Teams should incorporate practice standards, ethical codes, and other guidelines as part of the professional work\n- Free exchange of individual knowledge\n\n### Stakeholders\n\n- Must keep stakeholders properly engaged!\n- Typically the customer when PMBOK mentions stakeholders, BUT stakeholders are anyone affected by the project\n- Engaged stakeholders lead to greater project success and customer satisfaction\n- Stakeholders impact projects, performance and outcomes:\n  1. Scope/requirements\n  2. Schedule\n  3. Cost\n  4. Project team/resources\n  5. Plans\n  6. Outcomes\n  7. Culture\n  8. Benefit realization\n  9. Risk\n  10. Quality\n  11. Success\n- Identify, analyze, and proactively engage with stakeholders consists of finding out how, when, under what situations, and how often stakeholders should/want to be engaged\n- Interpersonal skills are important for this! Initiative, integrity, collaboration respect, empathy, confidence\n- This process will help project teams collect and utilize stakeholder feedback to minimize potential negative impacts and maximize positive ones\n\n### Value\n\n- Output of a project will provide value to your stakeholders\n- Continually evaluate and adjust project alignment to business objectives to maximize value\n- Value is the ultimate indicator of project success\n- Value can be realized at the end of a project (waterfall) or all throughout (Agile)\n- Values can be quantitative or qualitative\n- Focus on outcomes allows project teams to support the intended benefits that lead to value creation\n- Value is subjective and ultimately defined by stakeholders. We can use a \"business case\" to describe value in clearer terms:\n  - Business need - what is unique that this project provides? How does it satisfy a specific organizational need?\n  - Project Justification - Can you justify filling this need? Do the \"pros\" outweigh the \"cons\"?\n  - Business Strategy - How will you implement this solution to achieve the stated value?\n\n### Systems Thinking\n\n- Build a system to efficiently relate project components\n- A system is a set of interacting and independent components that function as a unified whole\n- A project is a system of interdependent and interacting domains of activity\n- Recognize, evaluate, and respond to the dynamic circumstances within and surrounding the project in a holistic way to positively affect project performance\n- How do internal project parts and external systems interact with each other?\n- Systems are constantly changing\n- Important that project teams think like this as well\n- An organization is also a system, so a project is one part within a larger system\n- Internal and external factors are always changing - one change can have many impacts\n\n### Leadership\n\n- Demonstrate and adapt leadership behaviors to support individual and team needs\n- Effective leadership promotes project success and contributes to positive project outcomes\n- Any project team member can demonstrate leadership\n- Leadership is different than authority\n- Effective leaders adapt their style to the situation\n- Effective leaders recognize different motivations among team members\n- Leaders demonstrate honesty, integrity, and ethical conduct\n- Effective projects have multiple team members using effective leadership skills (i.e., team leads)\n- Ensure leaders are aligned to avoid internal conflict\n- Authority is the right to exercise control. Authority is not leadership\n- Leadership is motivating and inspiring people to collaboratively achieve a common goal\n- PM AND team members can exhibit leadership skills, such as:\n  1. Focusing project team around shared goal\n  2. Articulating a motivating vision for the project\n  3. Generating consensus on the best way forward\n  4. Overcoming obstacles to project progress\n  5. Resolving conflict\n  6. Adapting communication style to stakeholders\n  7. Mentoring fellow team members\n  8. Having self-awareness of one's own bias and behaviors\n  9. Adapting to change during the project\n- Projects work best when leaders understand what motivates people!\n- By mixing styles and leveraging motivators, any project team member or stakeholder can motivate or influence the team\n\n### Tailoring\n\n- There are too many methods/approaches to count\n- This principle is deciding what is right for this project\n- Every project is unique (by definition)\n- Approach should be selected based on the needs of the project, its stakeholders, its governance, and its environment\n- \"Just enough\" process to accomplish desired outcome while maximizing value, minimizing cost, and enhancing speed\n- Tailoring is iterative! Adapt to your environment\n- Project team should always have an open mind about changing approaches\n- A tailored approach can lead to: deeper commitment from project team, reduction in waste, customer-oriented focus, increased efficiency\n\n### Quality\n\n- Never an excuse to not deliver value\n- Meeting the acceptance criteria for a deliverable\n- Quality is about satisfying stakeholders' expectations and fulfilling project and product requirements\n- Project quality ensures processes are appropriate and as effective as possible\n- Quality has many dimensions:\n  1. Performance - fast/powerful enough\n  2. Conformity - Meets all requirements\n  3. Reliability - Can be relied on\n  4. Resilience - Can take a hit\n  5. Satisfaction - Satisfies customers\n  6. Efficiency - Not wasteful\n  7. Sustainability - Can be produced/used without major restriction\n- Metrics and acceptance criteria are used to set standards for and test for quality\n- Team should understand acceptance criteria\n\n### Complexity\n\n- How to properly navigate project complexity\n- Complexity comes from: human behavior, system interactions, uncertainty, and ambiguity\n- Complexity can arise at any point during the project, sometimes can't be predicted!\n- Anticipate, evaluate, and navigate complexity and enable the project team to navigate that complexity\n- Complexity can be introduced by events and conditions, both internal and external\n- Stay vigilant in identifying complexity, and keep an open mind about what method to use in order to reduce complexity\n- Technological innovations can be a source of complexity\n\n### Risk\n\n- Everything has risk\n- Risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can have a positive or negative effect on one or more objectives\n- Risks can be positive OR negative\n  - Positive risk - \"opportunity\"\n  - Negative risk - \"threat\"\n- Always seek to maximize opportunities and minimize threats\n- Constantly evaluate and re-evaluate exposure to risk\n- Risk response must be:\n  - Appropriate for the magnitude of risk\n  - Cost-effective\n  - Realistic for project context\n  - Agreed to by relevant stakeholders\n  - Owned by a responsible person\n- Every organization has a risk \"appetite\" - this will affect how risk is managed\n\n### Adaptability and Resiliency\n\n- Adaptability is the ability to respond to changing conditions\n- Resiliency is the ability to absorb \"impacts\" and to recover quickly from a setback or failure\n- Build adaptability and resiliency into the organization's and project team's approaches\n- Focus on outcomes over outputs increases adaptability\n- A project rarely goes as planned!\n- A project exists in, and is constantly interacting with changing internal and external systems\n- A project is influenced by the system it exists in\n- Capabilities that support adaptability and resilience:\n  1. Short feedback loops\n  2. Continuous learning and improvement\n  3. Regular inspections\n  4. Open and transparent planning which engages the stakeholders\n  5. Small-scale prototypes, experiments, or demos\n  6. Open organizational communication\n  7. Diverse project teams with unique backgrounds and skills\n  8. Learning from the past\n- Having controls built-in keeps projects under budget and on time, by helping recover quickly from setbacks and changes\n- Learn from the past to speed up recovery further!\n\n### Change\n\n- Prepare those impacted for the acceptance to go from the current state to the intended future one (created by project output)\n- A structured approach will help with transitioning\n- Some stakeholders may not readily embrace change\n- Change can originate from internal or external sources\n- Change fatigue is the result of making too many changes in a short time\n- Change is best made incrementally\n- Stakeholder engagement and motivational approaches help with adoption\n- Remaining relevant is challenging, and change is essential to remain relevant\n- Change is challenging, so use motivation, not force","src/content/blog/project-management/studying-for-the-pmp-part-2-principles.md","1948a84b8ad37404",{"html":889,"metadata":890},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Disclaimer:\u003C/strong> I will be following \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewramdayal/\">Andrew Ramadayal\u003C/a>’s TIA Education course &#x26; book.

This part is an overview of the performance domains, according to PMI.\n\n## Overview\n\n- Group of related activities to ensure delivery of project outcomes\n- Interactive, interdependent, and interrelated\n- Specific activities will be determined by project context, stakeholders, etc...\n- Review PMBOK 6th ed. Fig. 1-1\n\n## Stakeholder Performance Domain\n\n- Addresses activities and functions associated with stakeholders\n- You want:\n  1. Productive working relationship with stakeholders\n  2. Stakeholder agreement with project objectives\n  3. Beneficiary stakeholders are satisfied, while opposition stakeholders don't negatively impact the project\n\n- Stakeholder Engagement Cycle:\n  1. Identify - who are your stakeholders and what do they want (ongoing)\n  2. Understand and Analyze - seek to understand stakeholder feelings and values\n  3. Prioritize - focus on stakeholders with the most power and interest\n  4. Engage - collaborate with stakeholders to introduce the project, gather requirements, manage expectations, resolve issues, negotiate,\n     prioritize, problem solve, and make decisions\n  5. Monitor - as the project progresses, stakeholders change and so do their requirements.\n\n### Checking Outcomes\n\n\u003Cimg alt=\"PMP outcomes vs. check chart for stakeholder performance domain\" src=\"\" />\n\n## Team Performance Domain\n\nDeals with activities and functions associated with the people doing the project work.\n\n- Outcomes:\n  1. Shared ownership\n  2. A high-performing team\n  3. Appropriate leadership and other interpersonal skills\n- This domain also includes establishing the culture that enables a set of diverse individuals to be a high-performing team.\n- Related terms:\n  1. Project Manager - team lead, responsible for the project\n  2. Project Management Team - others involved in project management\n  3. Project Team - the people doing the project work\n- Management activities include:\n  1. Meeting project objectives\n  2. Effective planning\n  3. Monitoring work\n  4. And others...\n- **Leadership** includes:\n  1. Influencing\n  2. Motivating\n  3. Listening\n  4. Enabling\n- Leadership can be centralized or distributed\n  1. Centralized: Accountability assigned to one person\n  2. Distributed: Shared among a project management team and team members\n- **Servant Leadership**: Understanding and addressing the needs of your team.

Correct development approach\n  2. A project life cycle that connects the delivery of business value with stakeholder value\n  3. Project life-cycle composed of phases that facilitate project deliverables\n- Projects can have a single delivery and some can have multiple deliveries\n  - Multiple deliveries can be periodic\n- Common Approaches:\n  1. Predictive (i.e. waterfall)\n  2. Adaptive Approach (i.e. agile)\n  3. Hybrid\n- Factors to determine approach:\n  - Dealing with the product:\n    1. Degree of innovation\n    2. Certainty of requirements\n    3. Scope stability\n    4. Ease of change\n    5. Delivery options\n    6. Risk\n    7. Safety requirements\n    8. Regulations\n  - Dealing with the project:\n    1.

Project deliverables\n    3. Organizational requirements\n    4. Market conditions\n    5. Legal or regulatory considerations\n  - Project planning considerations:\n    1. Delivery - scope of deliverables\n    2. Estimating - scope, schedule, budget, people, resources\n    3. Schedules - models to determine when work should be done\n    4. Budget\n- Planning for building a team starts with identifying required skills to complete the project\n- Communication plans must include stakeholder analysis and engagement\n- Physical resources are resources _other than people_\n- Procurement planning must happen throughout the project\n- Plan on how to deal with changes (i.e. a change plan)\n- Plan for risks that may be encountered\n\n### Checking Outcomes\n\n\u003Cimg alt=\"PMP outcomes vs. check chart for planning domain\" src=\"\" />\n\n## Work\n\n- Deals with activities and functions associated with establishing project processes, managing physical resources, and fostering a learning environment\n- All to do with performing the project work by the project team\n- Outcomes:\n  1. Efficient and effective project performance\n  2. Project processes are suitable for the project and environment\n  3. Appropriate stakeholder communication\n  4. Efficient management of physical resources\n  5. Procurement management\n  6. Continuous learning and team learning\n- Good planning includes:\n  1. Managing the flow of existing and new work\n  2. keeping the team focused\n  3. Establishing efficient project systems and processes\n  4. Communicating with stakeholders\n  5. Managing physical resources\n  6. Working with external vendors\n  7. Monitoring changes\n  8. Enabling project learning\n- Must periodically review your processes with the team\n- Process tailoring can be used to optimize for the context\n- Balance constraints like timelines and budgets to keep the team on track\n- Communicate and engage with stakeholders\n- Third-party resources must be accounted for\n- Physical resources need to be actively tracked\n- Manage procurement and vendors (bids, contracts)\n- Monitoring new work and changes\n- Retrospectives and lessons learned\n\n### Checking Outcomes\n\n\u003Cimg alt=\"PMP outcomes vs. check chart for work domain\" src=\"\" />\n\n## Delivery Performance Domain\n\n- Activities and functions related to delivering the scope and quality expected of the project\n- Outcomes include:\n  1. Project contributes to business objectives\n  2. Project realizes the outcomes\n  3. Project realized within the time frame\n  4. Project team has an understanding of requirements\n  5. Stakeholders accept the deliverables\n- Some projects deliver throughout and others deliver at the end in bulk.\n- PM must understand how the project provides value by:\n  1. Requirements gathering\n  2. Evolving and discovering requirements\n  3. Managing requirements\n  4. Define and decompose the scope\n- Quality is the ultimate factor in project completion.\n- Quality is reflected in:\n  1. Completion criteria\n  2. \"Definition of done\"\n  3. Statement of work\n  4. Requirements documentation\n- Cost of Quality:\n  1. Prevention - hiring better people\n  2. Appraisal - managing quality (ongoing)\n  3. Internal failure - cost of failure from internal sources\n  4. External failure - cost of failure from external sources\n\n### Checking Outcomes\n\n\u003Cimg alt=\"PMP outcomes vs. check chart for delivery domain\" src=\"\" />\n\n## Measurement Performance Domain\n\n- Activities and functions associated with assessing project performance and maintaining acceptable performance\n- Outcomes include:\n  1. Reliable understanding of project status\n  2. Actionable data to enable decision making\n  3. Timely and appropriate actions to keep the project on track\n  4. Achieving targets and generating business value\n- This domain bridges the Delivery Performance Domain with the Plan Performance Domain.\n- We measure for many reasons:\n  1. Evaluating performance compared to plan\n  2. Tracking utilization of resources\n  3. Demonstrating accountability\n  4. Providing information to stakeholders\n  5. Assessing whether project deliverables will meet customer acceptance criteria\n  6. Assessing whether project deliverables are on track\n- Creating effective measurements helps ensure the right things are being measured\n- Ways to measure:\n  - **Key Performance Indicators** (KPIs):\n    - Leading indicator - predicts changes or trends\n    - Lagging indicator - measures deliverables or events\n  - Utilize SMART\n    1. Specific\n    2. Meaningful\n    3. Achievable\n    4. Relevant\n    5. Timely\n  - Create a range: what is acceptable and what is unacceptable\n\n- What to measure:\n  1. Deliverables\n  - Errors or defects\n  - Measures of performance\n  2. Delivery\n  - Work in progress\n  - Lead time\n  - Cycle time\n  - Process efficiency\n  3. Baseline performance\n  - Start and finish dates\n  - Actual cost compared to planned cost\n  4. Resources\n  - Planned vs. actual resource utilization\n  5. Business value\n  - Cost-benefit ratio\n  6. Stakeholders\n  - Mood chart\n  7. Forecasts\n\n- Presenting metrics:\n  1. Dashboards\n  2. Information radiators (common in software teams)\n  3. Visual control\n\n- Pitfalls with measurements:\n\n1. Hawthorne effect - working to pass a specific measure/test rather than the actual requirements\n2. Vanity metric - judging team performance based on one metric\n3. Demoralization - common outcome of vanity metric, team feels demoralized\n4. Misuse - misrepresenting a metric (very easy to do unintentionally)\n5. Confirmation bias - measuring in a way that fits your bias\n\n### Checking Outcomes\n\n\u003Cimg alt=\"PMP outcomes vs. check chart for measurement domain\" src=\"\" />\n\n## Uncertainty\n\n- Deals with risk and uncertainty\n- Outcomes include:\n  1. An awareness of the environment around the project\n  2. Proactively exploring and responding to uncertainty\n  3. Awareness of interactions between many variables and the project\n  4. The capacity to anticipate threats and opportunities\n  5. Project delivery with little or no negative impact\n  6. Opportunities are realized to increase project performance and outcomes\n  7. Cost and schedule reserves are used\n- Projects happen in environments with varying uncertainty\n- Shades of uncertainty:\n  1. Risks - not knowing the future\n  2. Ambiguity - not aware of current or future conditions\n  3. Complexity - dynamic systems with unpredictable outcomes\n- Responding to uncertainty:\n  1. Gather as much data as possible\n  2. Plan and prepare for many different outcomes\n  3. Build-in resiliency\n- **Volatility** exists in environments subject to rapid and unpredictable change\n  - Can also occur when resources and skills are fluctuating\n\n### Checking Outcomes\n\n\u003Cimg alt=\"PMP outcomes vs. check chart for uncertainty domain\" src=\"\" />","src/content/blog/project-management/studying-for-the-pmp-part-3-performance-domains.md","02277add08b92fdc",{"html":952,"metadata":953},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Disclaimer:\u003C/strong> I will be following \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewramdayal/\">Andrew Ramadayal\u003C/a>’s TIA Education course &#x26; book.

motherboard.",[1014,1015,1016,1017],"EmuDev","Emulators","Low-Level","GBA","## Why a GBA Emulator\n\nHaving completed a CHIP8 emulator, I looked for my next emulation project and landed on the GBA. It's a big step up from CHIP8, but I think it's a relatively manageable project, especially since I will be focusing on implementing the \"GB\" part before the \"A\" part.\n\nMy overall goal is to contribute to larger emulation projects, and I see this as a step in that direction. I am hoping that once this project is complete, I'll have a much better understanding of emulation in general than CHIP8 could have given me.\n\n## Major Goals\n\n### Learn C++\n\nThough I have worked with C++ a few times throughout my years programming, I have never made a real effort to truly delve into the ecosystem. All of C++ projects have been pointed and specific enough that I didn't need to pick up C++ as a language, just whatever extensions over C I needed to complete the job at hand. This project will serve as a true C++ starter, where I will attempt to utilize C++ to the fullest extent.\n\n### RISC-V as the Primary Target\n\nThere are many GBA emulators out there. There are very likely a few that could be built for RISC-V out of the box and run with around the same level of compatibility as you would expect on any other hardware platform. However, to my knowledge, there aren't any (or at least many) GBA emulators that were written with RISC-V in mind as the primary compilation target.\n\nThis will be the main difference between this project and other GBA emulators. I foresee a lot of problems with SDL2 or whatever I/O library I end up picking, but it will serve as an awesome experience working directly with RISC-V hardware.\n\nTo clarify, all-platform compatibility is still the goal. However, RISC-V is the main platform I will be testing this on, and ensuring compatibility with x86_64 will come after.\n\n## Design Overview\n\n## Architecture Diagrams\n\nFirstly, while doing the preliminary research for this project, I found [this absolutely amazing website](https://www.copetti.org/) dedicated to dissecting console hardware and providing historical context to the development of their hardware and software. Thank you to [Rodrigo Copetti](https://www.copetti.org/support/) for the irreplaceable work he has done on his website. Specifically, I used his breakdown of the [GBA architecture](https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy-advance/) to kick-start my brainstorming. The below architecture diagram is from his site:\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"\" alt=\"GBA architecture diagram.\" />\n\n### Initial Component Breakdown\n\nImportant to implementing the GBA architecture is understanding all of its parts and how they operate. Thankfully, hundreds if not thousands of hardware gurus have compiled a vast amount of information throughout the web about the different parts of the GBA and how they operate.\n\n#### CPU\n\nThe GBA actually has two processors, which enables backwards compatibility with Game Boy games and higher performance for GBA games. Inside the GBA you will find both the Sharp SM83, which is the CPU that shipped with the Game Boy originally, and the ARM7TDMI. The SM83 is much simpler to implement, hence my intention to implement this first, before working on the ARM CPU. When one CPU is being used by a game, the other is switched off. Both CPUs are never running simultaneously.\n\nThis is the most standard part of the implementation. In general, there shouldn't be too many surprises while implementing the instruction sets of each CPU. The resources I will use to implement the instructions will be provided in a future post, once I turn my focus to implementing the CPU.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"\" alt=\"The Game Boy CPU\" />\n\n#### Bus\n\nContrary to what might actually be the best way to go about this implementation, I decided to implement the bus first, and then work on the CPU. I decided to go this route because the bus will be what decides much of the remainder of the architecture, and you don't need to know much about the rest of your implementation to get it to a nearly-complete state.\n\nThe bus has a simple job: given an address (from the CPU), communicate with the destination module what address needs to be read from or written to. The logic for writing and reading will actually be handled while implementing the memory.\n\n#### Memory\n\nThe memory design of the GBA is probably the second most complicated piece of the implementation, after the PPU. The GBA has several \"types\" of memory, distinguished by the memory ranges each one owns. Let's walk through an overview of the different types of memory:\n\n| **Address Range**        | Type                          | Compatibility | Usage Notes                                                                                       | Size   |\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |\n| `0x00000000-0x00003FFF`  | System ROM (bank 00)          | GB & GBA      | BIOS; executable only, no write                                                                   | 16 kB  |\n| `0x00004000-0x00007FFF`  | ROM (bank 01-NN)              | GB            | Switchable memory bank, helps to expand GB memory                                                 | 16 kB  |\n| `0x00008000-0x00009FFF`  | VRAM                          | GB            | In GCB mode, switchable bank 0/1                                                                  | 8 kB   |\n| `0x0000A000-0x0000BFFF`  | EWRAM                         | GB            | Work RAM external to the CPU (cartridge)                                                          | 8 kB   |\n| `0x0000C000-0x0000CFFF`  | IWRAM                         | GB            | Work RAM internal to the CPU (Bank 0, fixed).                                                     | 4 kB   |\n| `0x0000D000-0x0000DFFF`  | IWRAM                         | GB            | Work RAM internal to the CPU (Bank 1-7, CGB mode only)                                            | 4 kB   |\n| `0x0000E000-0x0000FDFF`  | Echo RAM                      | GB            | This memory should not be used.

I brought them together above to give an overview of what a fully backwards compatible GBA emulator would implement. Each address range has a respective \"Compatibility\" field to clarify which system uses which range. In general, you can bet that the GBA will use the higher address ranges (because it can) and the GB will use the lower address ranges (because it has to).\n\nThe memory design can get a little complicated, especially when factoring in [banking](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/MBCs.html#mbcs). This is going to be a piece of the implementation I plan to develop as I go.\n\n### Components Next Up\n\nI think implementing the CPU, Bus, and Memory will be enough of a challenge to start off, so I won't focus on all the components now. However, the other components in (likely) implementation order are:\n\n1. Cartridge Reader - pull data from actual ROMs to start testing with.\n2. PPU - get graphical output from ROMs.\n3. Key Controller - add user I/O.\n4. Sound Generator - important, but sound probably won't come until the end.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nIt's time to get started on the bus! The next blog post will cover the first few functions the bus will have to allow it to read and write memory. Alongside the bus, I will likely start the memory and CPU implementations as well (you need memory to read and write from).\n\n## Resources\n\nBelow is a list of all resources I utilized (and will be utilizing moving forward) to draft this hardware overview of the GBA.

There are very likely a few that could be built for RISC-V out of the box and run with around the same level of compatibility as you would expect on any other hardware platform. However, to my knowledge, there aren’t any (or at least many) GBA emulators that were written with RISC-V in mind as the primary compilation target.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This will be the main difference between this project and other GBA emulators. I foresee a lot of problems with SDL2 or whatever I/O library I end up picking, but it will serve as an awesome experience working directly with RISC-V hardware.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To clarify, all-platform compatibility is still the goal.

Inside the GBA you will find both the Sharp SM83, which is the CPU that shipped with the Game Boy originally, and the ARM7TDMI. The SM83 is much simpler to implement, hence my intention to implement this first, before working on the ARM CPU. When one CPU is being used by a game, the other is switched off. Both CPUs are never running simultaneously.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is the most standard part of the implementation. In general, there shouldn’t be too many surprises while implementing the instruction sets of each CPU. The resources I will use to implement the instructions will be provided in a future post, once I turn my focus to implementing the CPU.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"\" alt=\"The Game Boy CPU\">\n\u003C/section>\u003Csection class=\"heading\" data-heading-rank=\"4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"bus\">Bus\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>Contrary to what might actually be the best way to go about this implementation, I decided to implement the bus first, and then work on the CPU. I decided to go this route because the bus will be what decides much of the remainder of the architecture, and you don’t need to know much about the rest of your implementation to get it to a nearly-complete state.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The bus has a simple job: given an address (from the CPU), communicate with the destination module what address needs to be read from or written to.

I took the step at the start of this year by picking up the simplest architecture to emulate: [CHIP8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8). Its simplicity makes it a great starting place for interested \"EmuDevs\" (or \"emulator developers\"), and is widely regarded as the go-to first project within the emulation community.\n\n### Goal #1: Fetch → Decode → Execute\n\nWith that in mind, I set out with the goal of developing a CHIP8 emulator with the caveat of ensuring I apply the basic CPU cycle principle to my implementation (fetch → decode → execute). This isn't really atypical, but is notable for CHIP8 due to the fact that [it isn't a \"real\" ISA](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/comments/v70m3c/a_confusion_regarding_chip8_emulator/ibi65k8/)—there aren't any CHIP8 CPUs, historically. It was created as a platform intended to be emulated. Thus, some implementations are looser than the typical fetch, decode, and execute cycle. Therefore, I felt it was relevant to set as a goal.\n\nThis ended up looking like the code block below. The function returns as parameters was for fun, really not necessary. Realistically, the instructions can be placed on the global \"bus\" (the global instruction variable) and all functions can have 0 parameters and `void` returns.\n\n```c\nuint16_t fetch() { /* ... */ }\n\nuint16_t decode(uint16_t instr) { /* ... */ }\n\nvoid execute(uint8_t instr_t) { /* ... */ }\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n\twhile (PC != exit) {\n\t\texecute(decode(fetch()));\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Goal #2: Specification Only\n\nA secondary goal was that I didn't want to use anything but the CPU specification to implement the main emulator logic. I wanted to attempt the implementation with as little support as possible, to up the challenge a bit.\n\n### Goal #3: I Miss C\n\nLastly, I hadn't used C or C++ in more than a year due to my full-time job being a primarily web-development role, so this was an opportunity for me to get back up to speed on my C knowledge. Before I started this project, I redid one of my projects from college: a CLI tokenizer. I can't overstate how nice of a project this is to spin up on a language quickly. It's not _so_ involved that it would take you a week or more, but it is just involved enough that you will be dealing with a lot of quirks for any given language.\n\n## Implementation Resources\n\n### Specification Sheet\n\nFirst, there is the holy grail of CHIP8 implementation resources, [Cogwod's technical specification](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM). This is pretty much the community go-to base resource for implementing a CHIP8 emulator. If you want the greatest challenge and/or you already have a background in CPU architecture, I'd recommend trying to implement only using that document.\n\n### High Level Guide\n\nNext, there is the oft recommended [guide from Tobias V. Langhoff's](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/). This guide does a great job of breaking down the concepts into more digestible bites while not totally spoiling the implementation for you. I'd recommend trying to implement with Cogwods and this guide if you have little to no background knowledge on CPUs and/or you would like a moderate challenge.\n\n### Thorough Code Breakdown\n\nLastly, there is a full, thorough implementation [guide from Austin Morlan](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/). Do note that this guide is using C++, not C strictly. However, most concepts carry over. If you want to go through the motions of putting together an emulator before trying something else, or if you get stuck while implementing, this guide has thorough explanations for each piece of the specification.\n\n## My Implementation\n\n**Disclaimer:** while writing my implementation, I aimed at making it more compact than anything else, so please excuse the lack of readability! I tried to document a lot with comments to overcome the compact presentation of the code itself.\n\nAdditionally, this isn't intended to be a guide, per se. It's more so a personal accounting of why I started the project and what interesting quirks came with it during implementation. I highly recommend one of the two guides above if that is what you're looking for. Feel free to comment or send me questions about my implementation, though!\n\n### Loading the ROM\n\nThis was the first piece of the emulator I decided to implement. I grabbed the first file from [Timendus' CHIP8 Test Suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite) and saved it to my repository as a baseline for checking the implementation as I go. Unfortunately, pretty much every test requires the graphics portion of the project to be completed in order to view the test results. However, while the drawing functionality wasn't ready yet, I used VS Code's built-in debugger to watch each register as instructions executed.\n\nAny external I/O was placed in a `peripherals.c` file, including the \"ROM drive\".\n\n#### Endianness\n\nROM loading is actually more difficult than you might expect, thanks to a concept known as \"endianness\". Essentially, endianness refers to the order in which bytes are placed in and loaded from memory. While usually we (Romantic and Germanic language speakers) like to think in terms of left → right for reading and writing order (\"big endian order\"), typically bytes of memory are stored in the opposite order. Here is an example of what that actually looks like for the hex value `0x123456`:\n\n|                   | Byte 0 | Byte 1 | Byte 2 |\n| ----------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| **Big Endian**    | `0x12` | `0x34` | `0x56` |\n| **Little Endian** | `0x56` | `0x34` | `0x12` |\n\nSo why does this add difficulty? It's only difficult when the host system has a different endianness than the emulated platform. For the vast majority of people, this would be true for a CHIP8 emulator. Further, your implementation should work independent of the host endianness.\n\nWhat's the solution? Load the bytes in from host memory and flip high and low bytes if the host system is \"little endian\". The goal is that, once the CHIP8 processor starts moving through the instructions, the CHIP8's memory is represented in \"big endian\" format. This was the approach I took, at least. There is almost certainly a better way to do this, however this was simple enough, and it worked in my case. You can easily check the endianness of the host system using a trick [like this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12792301/20411790).\n\n### Memory\n\nThe memory for a CHIP8 emulator is pretty much as simple as it gets in the world of emulators—a fixed-length array of size 4096 bytes. In my case, this was allocated at runtime with the following instruction:\n\n```c\nuint8_t mem[4096];\n```\n\nSimple enough, right? Besides that, I also initialized our \"register file\", or the set of registers native to the CHIP8 platform ('V' is used thanks to CHIP8 convention):\n\n```c\nuint8_t V[16];\n```\n\nIt's not necessary to go through how I initialized each and every variable, but other \"memory\" related variables included the stack pointer and the stack, the program counter, delay and sound timers, the memory register, the screen buffer (more on this later), and the keyboard buffer. I also opted to emulate the \"bus\" with an `instr_bus` global variable.\n\n### The CPU\n\nThis is the \"meat\" of the emulator. This piece is what the specification from Cogwod I linked above defines. It's also more or less the least interesting, thanks to the fact that the implementation is relatively standard. The only moderately distinct implementation feature I adopted was completely bit-wise operations.\n\nI chose to subtract from the delay and sound timers in the \"decode\" phase of the cycle. Technically, with my current implementation, the delay timer wouldn't work all that great thanks to the fact that I chose to speed up the base clock of the CPU to make keyboard entry and graphical output more functional/fluid. This is something I'll likely fix in the future. I will possibly include this as a fix before I expand the CHIP8 code I have now into a web assembly project/tool.\n\nThe only other interesting feature of the CPU implementation is for the `0xD`, or draw, instruction. That piece I will cover in the next section on graphics.\n\n### The Graphics\n\nThe only part of the graphical implementation that is directly related to the CHIP8 specification is the instruction used to draw to the video buffer. Everything else graphics related is drawing the video buffer with SDL2.\n\n#### The `0xDxyn` Instruction\n\nThis is a mildly infamous instruction thanks to its difficulty to implement properly (especially compared to the relatively straightforward instructions leading up to this one). There are a lot of ways to go about it, but this is how I tackled this piece. Firstly, there is the video buffer. The CHIP8 video buffer is a 64x32-pixel buffer made up of monochrome (1-bit) pixels. I represented it with the following matrix:\n\n```c\nuint8_t screen[8][32];\n```\n\nYou may have noticed that the x-dimension is set to 8 bytes. This is due to the fact that, in the x-direction, each bit within each byte is a pixel. Given 8 bits to a byte, this makes our 64x32 matrix.\n\nNext, the instruction definition:\n\n```c\nswitch(instr_t) {\n\t// ...\n\n\tcase 0xD:\n\t/* drw / draw sprite from I at (Vx, Vy)*/\n\tV[0xF] = 0;\n\tfor(int i = 0; i \u003C (instr_bus&0x000F); i++) {\n\t\tint index_x, index_y, offset;\n\n\t\tindex_x = V[x]>>3; // which byte to access\n\t\tindex_y = (V[y] + i) % 32; // height of byte\n\t\toffset = 8-(V[x]%8); // offset of wrapped byte\n\n\t\t// collision detection:\n\t\tif((screen[index_x][index_y] & (mem[I+i]>>(V[x]%8))) ||\n\t\t   (screen[(index_x+1)%8][index_y] & (mem[I+i]\u003C\u003Coffset))) {\n\t\t\tV[0xF] = 1;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// write to buffer\n\t\tscreen[index_x][index_y] ^= (mem[I+i]>>(V[x]%8));\n\t\tscreen[(index_x+1)%8][index_y] ^= (mem[I+i]\u003C\u003Coffset);\n\t}\n\tbreak;\n\n\t// ...\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, it's not exactly the most straightforward piece of code, _especially_ if you decide to represent each pixel with a bit and not a byte. The byte representation makes for a much easier implementation, but is less compact (no need to set bits to 1 and 0, just set the whole byte).\n\nA few things to note about the implementation:\n\n1. Note that `x >> y` is equivalent to `x * 2^y`. So `V[x]>>3` is really `V[x] * 2^3` or simply `V[x] * 8`. The opposite holds true, as well (`x \u003C\u003C y` is `x / 2^y`).\n2. You always have to keep wrapped bits in mind. If you draw 4 horizontal pixels to the buffer at bit position 63 (indexed at 0), there are 3 bits hanging off that need to be drawn. The CHIP8 specification says that those bit should be wrapped around to `x = x + 1` at the same `y` level.\n3. Collision should be checked before writing to the buffer. I used bit-wise `&` to check for collisions, but there are other ways to do this, as well. Collisions result in the colliding pixel to turn off, thanks to the `XOR` operation that the CHIP8 specification requires for writing to the buffer.\n\n#### SDL2 Output\n\nThis was the roughest part of the project for me. Due to the fact that it's unrelated to the CPU, in my opinion, I did use a few external resources to complete this piece. I had never worked with a graphics library like SDL in the past, so everything was new to me. The only interesting portion of my video implementation was the `draw_screen(...)` function, which ended up looking like:\n\n```c\nvoid draw_screen(uint8_t screen[8][32], SDL_Renderer* renderer) {\n  SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 0, 0, 0, 255);\n  SDL_RenderClear(renderer);\n  SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 255, 255, 255, 255);\n\n  for (int i = 0; i \u003C 32; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j \u003C 8; j++) {\n      for (int k = 0; k \u003C 8; k++) {\n        if (screen[j][i] & (0b10000000 >> k)) {\n          SDL_Rect rect;\n          rect.x = ((j * 8) + k) * SCALE;\n          rect.y = i * SCALE;\n          rect.w = SCALE;\n          rect.h = SCALE;\n          SDL_RenderFillRect(renderer, &rect);\n          // O avg = 32 * 64, no larger than any other implementation.\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);\n}\n```\n\nSome notes:\n\n1. Make sure to call `SDL_Init` and `SDL_Quit`, alongside any `_Destroy` functions (i.e. for `Renderer` and `Window`). These happen in separate \"initialize\" and \"terminate\" functions in my implementation.\n2. `SCALE` is a nice addition to the implementation. It multiplies the size of all size-related values (window size, \"pixel\" height, \"pixel\" width) so you can create larger view-ports for a clearer image.\n3. C experts will scoff at this point, but this was one of the things I forgot, having not used C in a while. **REMEMBER:** If the function you are calling takes in a parameter that it will mutate (lets say, a pointer to a struct) you must pass a POINTER to that pointer!\n   1. This is actually dependent on how the function mutates the parameter. If it is dereferencing the pointer and changing a field or a value within, then you only need to pass the pointer.\n   2. If the function is creating a new `struct` and setting the passed in pointer to a new pointer to the new `struct` you must pass a pointer to a pointer.\n   3. If this makes no sense, read [this Stack Overflow explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30717999) a few times and I think it will become clear.\n\n### The Sound\n\nI more or less stopped development on the project at this point. I wanted to implement sound, but it was an effort that was far from the initial point of this project (to develop my first emulator). However, I still gave it a shot and got _something_, but its mostly just static noise. Funny enough, this is thanks to the fact that I am taking a modern sound system (SDL2) and attempting to make it fit this use case (monotone beeps) which seems harder than if I just wanted to play some audio from a file (like most modern use-cases in games and such).\n\nHere's the code I could make out, based on a kind soul on Stack Overflow:\n\n```c\nconst int AMPLITUDE = 28000;\nconst int SAMPLE_RATE = 44100;\n\nvoid audio_callback(void* user_data, Uint8* raw_buffer, int bytes) {\n  Sint16* buffer = (Sint16*)raw_buffer;\n  int length = bytes / 2;  // 2 bytes per sample for AUDIO_S16SYS\n  int* sample_nr = (int*)user_data;\n\n  for (int i = 0; i \u003C length; i++) {\n    double time = (double)sample_nr[i] / (double)SAMPLE_RATE;\n    buffer[i] = (Sint16)(AMPLITUDE * sin(2.0f * 3.1415f * 441.0f *\n                                         time));  // render 441 HZ sine wave\n  }\n}\n\nvoid play_beep() {\n  int sample_nr = 0;\n  SDL_AudioSpec want;\n  want.freq = SAMPLE_RATE;\n  want.format = AUDIO_S16SYS;\n  want.channels = 1;\n  want.samples = 512;\n  want.callback =\n      audio_callback;\n  want.userdata =\n      &sample_nr;\n  SDL_AudioSpec have;\n  if (SDL_OpenAudio(&want, &have) != 0)\n    SDL_LogError(SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_AUDIO, \"Failed to open audio: %s\",\n                 SDL_GetError());\n  if (want.format != have.format)\n    SDL_LogError(SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_AUDIO, \"Failed to get the desired AudioSpec\");\n\n  SDL_PauseAudio(0);  // start playing sound\n}\n\nvoid stop_beep() { SDL_PauseAudio(1); }\n```\n\nAs I mentioned previously, this implementation basically isn't working. I'm sure I've managed to mix some part of this up, since I couldn't find great docs on it. If you have some suggestions on how to fix this code up, please do let me know in the comments!\n\n## Testing and Compatibility\n\n### Timendus Test Suite\n\nSpecial thanks to [Timendus for their test suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite). It's a great resource for more CHIP8 tests than you would ever need. After running the main few to confirm full functionality (keypad, opcodes, and flags tests), I downloaded a few games to test.\n\n### Compatibility (and Demo)\n\nCompatibility is a little hit or miss, unfortunately. This may be thanks to the variety of CHIP8 extensions out there and some improper labeling. Regardless, for most games that I tested, they worked as expected.\n\n**Thanks for sticking around and reading through this!** Hopefully this was helpful, insightful or really anything of value to you. Feel free to leave a comment down below if you have a question or suggestion!\n\nBefore you go, below is a video of a Breakout remake for CHIP8 I used to test (choppy video is only due to the `GIF` format, the actual render is a _little_ better).

This isn’t really atypical, but is notable for CHIP8 due to the fact that \u003Ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/comments/v70m3c/a_confusion_regarding_chip8_emulator/ibi65k8/\">it isn’t a “real” ISA\u003C/a>—there aren’t any CHIP8 CPUs, historically. It was created as a platform intended to be emulated. Thus, some implementations are looser than the typical fetch, decode, and execute cycle. Therefore, I felt it was relevant to set as a goal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This ended up looking like the code block below. The function returns as parameters was for fun, really not necessary.

Unfortunately, pretty much every test requires the graphics portion of the project to be completed in order to view the test results.

Essentially, endianness refers to the order in which bytes are placed in and loaded from memory. While usually we (Romantic and Germanic language speakers) like to think in terms of left → right for reading and writing order (“big endian order”), typically bytes of memory are stored in the opposite order. Here is an example of what that actually looks like for the hex value \u003Ccode>0x123456\u003C/code>:\u003C/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003Ctable>\u003Cthead>\u003Ctr>\u003Cth>\u003C/th>\u003Cth>Byte 0\u003C/th>\u003Cth>Byte 1\u003C/th>\u003Cth>Byte 2\u003C/th>\u003C/tr>\u003C/thead>\u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Big Endian\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>\u003Ccode>0x12\u003C/code>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>\u003Ccode>0x34\u003C/code>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>\u003Ccode>0x56\u003C/code>\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Little Endian\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>\u003Ccode>0x56\u003C/code>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>\u003Ccode>0x34\u003C/code>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>\u003Ccode>0x12\u003C/code>\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003C/tbody>\u003C/table>\n\u003Cp>So why does this add difficulty? It’s only difficult when the host system has a different endianness than the emulated platform. For the vast majority of people, this would be true for a CHIP8 emulator. Further, your implementation should work independent of the host endianness.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What’s the solution? Load the bytes in from host memory and flip high and low bytes if the host system is “little endian”. The goal is that, once the CHIP8 processor starts moving through the instructions, the CHIP8’s memory is represented in “big endian” format. This was the approach I took, at least. There is almost certainly a better way to do this, however this was simple enough, and it worked in my case. You can easily check the endianness of the host system using a trick \u003Ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/12792301/20411790\">like this\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/section>\u003C/section>\u003Csection class=\"heading\" data-heading-rank=\"3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"memory\">Memory\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The memory for a CHIP8 emulator is pretty much as simple as it gets in the world of emulators—a fixed-length array of size 4096 bytes.

Technically, with my current implementation, the delay timer wouldn’t work all that great thanks to the fact that I chose to speed up the base clock of the CPU to make keyboard entry and graphical output more functional/fluid. This is something I’ll likely fix in the future. I will possibly include this as a fix before I expand the CHIP8 code I have now into a web assembly project/tool.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The only other interesting feature of the CPU implementation is for the \u003Ccode>0xD\u003C/code>, or draw, instruction.

straightforward piece of code, \u003Cem>especially\u003C/em> if you decide to represent each pixel with a bit and not a byte. The byte representation makes for a much easier implementation, but is less compact (no need to set bits to 1 and 0, just set the whole byte).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A few things to note about the implementation:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>Note that \u003Ccode>x >> y\u003C/code> is equivalent to \u003Ccode>x * 2^y\u003C/code>. So \u003Ccode>V[x]>>3\u003C/code> is really \u003Ccode>V[x] * 2^3\u003C/code> or simply \u003Ccode>V[x] * 8\u003C/code>. The opposite holds true, as well (\u003Ccode>x &#x3C;&#x3C; y\u003C/code> is \u003Ccode>x / 2^y\u003C/code>).\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You always have to keep wrapped bits in mind. If you draw 4 horizontal pixels to the buffer at bit position 63 (indexed at 0), there are 3 bits hanging off that need to be drawn. The CHIP8 specification says that those bit should be wrapped around to \u003Ccode>x = x + 1\u003C/code> at the same \u003Ccode>y\u003C/code> level.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Collision should be checked before writing to the buffer. I used bit-wise \u003Ccode>&#x26;\u003C/code> to check for collisions, but there are other ways to do this, as well. Collisions result in the colliding pixel to turn off, thanks to the \u003Ccode>XOR\u003C/code> operation that the CHIP8 specification requires for writing to the buffer.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003C/section>\u003Csection class=\"heading\" data-heading-rank=\"4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"sdl2-output\">SDL2 Output\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>This was the roughest part of the project for me.
